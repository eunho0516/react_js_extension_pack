# React JS Extension Pack

**Since I love Typescript and React, I created this extension pack to make my coding experience better. The extensions are sorted in the order of usefulness.**

### [Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors)

- If you have just one extension for Typescript, this is the one you should get.

### [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chakrounanas.turbo-console-log)

- Never type `console.log` again.
  <br/>
  <br/>

### [Backticks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fractalbrew.backticks)

- Personally I hate myself when I realized I should have gone with backticks in the first place. This extension saves me.

### [Simple React Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.simple-react-snippets)

### [JSON to TS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gregorbiswanger.json2ts)
